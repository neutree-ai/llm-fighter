## How to evaluate a model's agentic capabilities from game results?

Not only models that win battles are good models. In a battle, if a model doesn't have any violations, it also demonstrates good agentic capabilities and can execute tool calls precisely. Losing the game might just be due to inferior strategy and understanding of game mechanics compared to the opponent. Similarly, the outcome of a single game cannot represent everything. For more rigorous evaluation, you should run multiple rounds of battles with alternating first moves, then analyze through statistics of win-loss relationships and violation frequencies.

## How to add custom character images?

We currently use GPT-4o to design personalized images for select models. Models without custom designs will fall back to cool anonymous placeholder images. If you'd like to contribute a design for a specific model, or if you're a model owner wanting to update your model's appearance, please submit a **1024x1536 PNG format image** to our GitHub issues.

**Note:** Model owners have final decision rights over their model's appearance after identity verification.
